# The likelihood of childbearing based on educational, socioeconomic, and interpersonal factors

According to the White House, in 2023,
the CDC reported that the birth rate had fallen to its lowest
level in history1
. There have been multiple reasons discovered
by researchers as to why the US birth rate has been declining
for decades, such as social and economic disparities, and the
increased age at which many Americans are choosing to
become parents, if at all2
.  This report will study how several
factors impact the likelihood of a person in the US having
children. The most impactful factors will enable researchers
to propose effective policies that will provide more support for
Americans to have children. 
For this project, a logistic regression model will be used to
examine five factors that may increase or decrease the
likelihood of an individual having children.
