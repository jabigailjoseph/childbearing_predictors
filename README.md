# The likelihood of childbearing based on educational, socioeconomic, and interpersonal factors

## Project Overview
#### According to the White House (2023), the CDC reported that the U.S. birth rate had fallen to its lowest level in history1. Researchers have identified multiple contributing factors to the decades-long decline in birth rates, including:

### Social and economic disparities
#### Increased age at parenthood
#### Changing societal norms
#### This report investigates how various factors impact the likelihood of individuals in the U.S. having children. By identifying the most impactful predictors, researchers and policymakers can propose effective policies that provide support for Americans who choose to have children.

### Project Objective
#### The goal of this project is to use a logistic regression model to examine the relationship between the likelihood of having children and the following five factors:

#### Marital Status
#### Educational Attainment
#### Income Level
#### Health Coverage
#### Sexual Orientation
#### The analysis identifies which factors most significantly increase or decrease the likelihood of childbearing.

### Methodology
#### Dataset: Publicly available National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) data
#### Techniques: Logistic Regression, Confounding Assessment, Multicollinearity Checks (VIF), AIC Analysis
#### Tools: R Programming Language

### Significance
#### The results from this study will help:

#### Identify key predictors influencing childbearing decisions.
#### Inform policymakers on which socioeconomic and interpersonal factors require more support.
#### Enable future research on strategies to address declining fertility rates in the U.S.
